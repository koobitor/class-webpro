<h1> <i>My Japan Internship Program</i></h1>

<h2>Welcome to my page</h2>


<p id="first">I always heard that Japan has better technology than many other countries in Asia. Japan is a
smaller country but more advanced than Thailand. I think it is a great experience doing my
internship here. Their tools and resources were very good for me to further my study as a computer
science student. This opportunity is essential for me to achieve in my field in the future.</p>

<p id="second">Japan is so much different from Thailand. Japanese culture and livelihood are completely different.
It has four seasons. It has higher living costs. Nothing is easy here. It is quite challenging.</p>
